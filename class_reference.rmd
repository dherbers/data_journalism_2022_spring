## Introduction

Consider this a personal guide to the commands and functions you will learn. In general, when you come across an R command or function that you want to remember, put it in here along with a description of what it does and when you'd use it.

## Things I learned on Jan.27

the command to set a working directory is setwd()
```{r}
setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/data_journalism_2022_spring")
```
you can run individual commands in markdown notebooks
library-ing the tidyverse is very important

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```
